# OSIC Ease of Use guide
Welcome to the OSIC Cluster Ease of deployment guide repo. The purpose of this repo is to create the ease of use guide that will allow Operators/Enthusiasts in deploying Openstack in Multinode cluster in a simplistic and faster manner.

# What Problems does it solve ?
When it comes to deployment tool adoption, one of the key factor to consider is to have an easy to use deployment guide that customers can use to deploy Openstack. The demand for ease-of-use along with faster deployments are increasing. Customers are consolidating their server, storage and networking environments and are trying to get more functionality with less complexity. We at the OSIC Ops Team have validated Openstack using Kolla on a 100 Bare Metal node ([summary](https://github.com/osic/ref-impl-kolla/blob/master/documents/validation_kolla.md)) cluster using this guide.
